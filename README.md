- Provide recommendations to improve security based on findings

## Scope

- Public-facing web pages and resources only
- No access to authenticated or restricted areas
- No intrusive scanning or exploitation attempts
- Use of open-source intelligence (OSINT) and passive analysis tools only

## Methodology

The assessment followed these key phases:

1. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering technical and infrastructure information using tools such as WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Shodan, and DNS enumeration.
2. **Passive Security Analysis:** Checking HTTPS setup and HTTP security headers using SSL Labs and SecurityHeaders.com.
3. **Content Review:** Manual inspection of publicly accessible content, error messages, and exposed files.
4. **Vulnerability Research:** Identifying any known vulnerabilities associated with detected technologies.
5. **Reporting:** Documenting findings with evidence and recommendations.

## Tools Used

- WhatWeb  
- BuiltWith  
- Shodan  
- DNS Enumeration (dig, nslookup)
